# PoW vs PoS

## Proof of Work

> Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well known blockchains that use a proof of work consensus protocol.

Proof of work (PoW) blockchains require network participants, also known as “miners,” to guess the solution to a complex mathematical problem in order to add a “block” to the decentralized public ledger. The miner that solves or comes closest to solving the problem earns a prize for their work, usually in the form of the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency.

> Proof of work blockchains are able to be extremely decentralized because anyone with the necessary hardware and skillset can participate in the consensus.

> Proof of work blockchains often consume significant amounts of energy when operating at a large scale, and face scalability issues which can make basic transactions slower and more expensive for the average user.

## Proof of Stake

> Umee is a proof of stake blockchain. Other well known proof of stake blockchains include Cosmos, Solana, Polkadot, and Cardano.

Proof of stake (PoS) blockchains require participants, also known as **“validators,”** to lock up, or **“stake,”** coins/tokens on the network as a form of collateral. Validators are randomly selected to “validate” a block that will be added to the decentralized public ledger once a consensus has been reached. Block rewards are split between validators according to the amount of coins/tokens they have staked relative to the total amount staked.

On rare occasions validators can be **“slashed.”** Slashing occurs when a validator misbehaves, and a percentage of their total stake is redistributed or burnt as a punishment. There are two scenarios in which an Umee validator’s stake is slashed:

- When a validator has significant downtime, and is not actively contributing to the validation of blocks; 

- When a validator “double signs,” or signs the same block twice. Validators who double sign will also be "tombstone jailed," or kicked from the active set and unable to rejoin.

> Proof of stake blockchains become more decentralized as more validators participate.

> Proof of stake blockchains allow all coin/token holders to earn block rewards.

>Proof of stake blockchains consume a small fraction of the energy that proof of work blockchains demand.

>Proof of stake blockchains are more scalable by design, meaning transactions are usually fast and inexpensive for the average user, and more applications can be built on top.

## Staking

Coin/token holders have the ability to **“delegate”** their tokens to a validator to help the network remain secure and decentralized. In return, those who delegate their assets earn **“staking rewards,”** a proportional share of the block rewards relative to the amount of tokens they have staked. Additionally, those who delegate their assets are typically able to participate in protocol governance decisions to help determine the future of the network.

It’s incredibly important for any proof of stake network to have a significant percentage of the total supply of coins/tokens staked at all times in order to increase the cost associated with an attack so it’s not attainable and/or profitable for a bad actor.

In order to encourage coin/token holders to stake their tokens to help secure the network, most proof of stake blockchains initially use a strategically chosen token inflation rate so that coin/token holders who do not delegate/stake are penalized by having their market share diluted.

Validators with greater amounts of coins/tokens staked will have higher chances of being selected to validate a block, as well as greater influence over governance processes. It’s essential for coin/token holders to choose carefully when selecting a validator to stake with. If the majority of total tokens staked are staked by a handful of validators, the network becomes less decentralized and secure.

> Token holders should delegate to validators with smaller stakes in order to help support the decentralization and security of the network.
