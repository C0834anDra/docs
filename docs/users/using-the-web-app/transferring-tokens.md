## IBC Transfers

_**If you have Cosmos assets like ATOM on a different network in your Umee blockchain compatible wallet, follow this guide to transfer them to Umee.**_

> _**Cosmos transfers only require an**_ [Umee blockchain compatible wallet]() _**like Keplr.**_

> ### Prerequisites
>
> * [Must have an Umee blockchain compatible wallet]()
> * [Must have UMEE tokens to transact on the Umee blockchain]()
> * _**Must have**_ [Cosmos assets like ATOM]() _**to transfer to or from Umee.**_

## To Transfer Cosmos Assets to Umee:

**Make sure your** [Umee wallet]() and the wallet you're transferring from are [connected to the web app]().

**On the "Markets" page, select "Cosmos."**

> _**When "Cosmos" is selected tokens will be transferred between their native chains and the Umee blockchain, with the exception of native UMEE tokens which are already on the Umee blockchain.**_

**Identify which asset you’d like to transfer on to Umee and select “Transfer” in the appropriate row.**

![For this example we will be transferring ATOM from the Cosmos Hub.]()

**Select which network you'd like to transfer **_**to**_** on the top of the pop-up.**

> _**To transfer assets off of Umee and back to their native chain, simply select the destination chain here.**_

![We will be selecting "UMEE" since we are transferring ATOM onto the Umee blockchain.]()

**In the pop-up, input the amount of tokens you’d like to transfer, select “Transfer,” and approve the transaction in your wallet.**

> ### Prerequisites (Umee <> Ethereum)
>
> * [Must have an Umee blockchain compatible wallet]()
> * Must have an Ethereum wallet (e.g. MetaMask)
> * [Must have an UMEE balance to pay for transactions on Umee]()

#### Umee to Ethereum Transfers

_**Umee's Gravity Bridge allows users to transfer assets between the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems. If you'd like to transfer assets from the Umee blockchain to Ethereum, follow the steps below.**_

> _**UMEE tokens that are bridged to Ethereum cannot be used to pay for gas fees on the Umee network, staked to earn staking yield, or used to participate in governance.**_

> _**Transactions on Ethereum may be significantly slower and more expensive than transactions on the Umee blockchain. Make sure you have an ETH balance in your Ethereum wallet before transferring tokens to Ethereum.**_

> ### _**Prerequisites (Umee <> Ethereum)**_
