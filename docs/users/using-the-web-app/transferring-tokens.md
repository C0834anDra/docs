## Ethereum to Umee Transfers

> If you are in possession of [ERC-20 UMEE](/overview/umee-token/token-format), or if you'd like to access native Ethereum assets while enjoying Umee's fast and inexpensive transactions, use this guide to bridge ERC-20 assets to Umee.

> Ethereum -> Umee transfers require both an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) and an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.

#### 6) Confirm that the Umee destination wallet address is correct. If you're transferring an asset that's not UMEE, make sure you have an UMEE token balance in your Umee wallet to pay for transactions on the Umee network.

## Umee to Ethereum Transfers

> Transactions on Ethereum may be significantly slower and more expensive than transactions on the Umee blockchain. Make sure you have an ETH balance in your Ethereum wallet before transferring tokens to Ethereum.

> Umee -> Ethereum transfers require both an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) and an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.
