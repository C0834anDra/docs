#### Select the asset you’d like to supply on the Umee market.

![For this example we will supply native UMEE tokens.](/bg/supply-2.png)

#### On the pop-up, input the amount you’d like to supply and select “Supply.” Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

> DO NOT SUPPLY 100% OF YOUR UMEE Tokens! All transactions on the Umee Network will require a small UMEE balance for the gas fee.

#### You have now supplied assets on the Umee market and will begin earning lending interest on your deposit! You may now use your deposit as collateral to [borrow from the Umee market](/users/using-the-web-app/borrow-repay) if you'd like.

## Withdrawing Assets from Umee

> Withdrawing assets that are being used as collateral will negatively impact users' [loan to value ratios](/users/using-the-web-app/common-terms.html#maximum-ltv) and increase their risk of liquidation.

#### To withdraw assets, select the asset you’d like to withdraw from the Supply page.

![For this example we will be withdrawing UMEE.](/bg/withdraw-1.png)

#### Select “Withdraw” on the top of the pop-up.
