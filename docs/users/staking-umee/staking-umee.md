# Staking UMEE

![](/bg/staking-umee.png)

[Staking](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-staking) is the safest and easiest way for UMEE holders to earn more [UMEE tokens](/overview/umee-token). By staking UMEE tokens, a user is delegating their tokens to a validator to help secure the Umee blockchain in return for a proportional share of block rewards being earned by the validator.

#### The "[Voting Power](/users/staking-umee/selecting-validator)" column represents the total amount of tokens staked with a validator.

#### The "[Commission](/users/staking-umee/selecting-validator)" column represents the percentage of staking rewards a validator retains for their services.

![Validators earn a commission on total staking rewards accrued, NOT the total amount of tokens staked with them.](/bg/stake-umee-4.png)

#### After finding a validator that interests you, select “Manage” in the right hand column. You will now see the validator's bio, where validators often share additional details community members may find helpful.
