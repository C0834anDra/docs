# Governance

![](/bg/governance.png)

Umee will use an on-chain governance structure for text proposals, changes in consensus parameters, and the use of funds from the community and ecosystem pools. Governance proposals are voted on by community members who stake UMEE; when community members who stake their UMEE fail to vote before a deadline, their vote is granted to the validator they have delegated their stake to. [_<mark style="color:blue;">You can learn how to vote on a governance proposal here</mark>_]().

Since Umee’s governance takes place on-chain, the results of votes are always visible by everyone. Additionally, votes can trigger on-chain events that can not be stopped by any single person or group of people including the Umee core team.

Umee aims to make the governance process as easy and accessible as possible. If you have any suggestions, please share them with the community in the [<mark style="color:blue;">#suggestions</mark>](https://discord.gg/9Mw2nJW9Kv) channel on the Umee Discord server.

## Governance Process

**There are three main steps for any governance proposal on the Umee Hub:**

1. <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">**Drafting the Proposal**<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark></mark>]()
2. <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">**The Deposit Period**<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark></mark>]()
3. <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>[<mark style="color:blue;">**The Voting Period**<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark></mark>]()

### Drafting the Proposal

First, an idea should gain traction within the community and a proposal should be drafted. Community members should utilize the appropriate channels on [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee’s Commonwealth</mark>](https://commonwealth.im/umee/) and [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee's Discord</mark>](https://discord.gg/YukEZy8nkc) to discuss potential proposals before starting the draft process. Proposal ideas should be reviewed rigorously before taking any further steps.

### The Deposit Period

The deposit period refers to the period of time where UMEE token deposits need to be made in order to demonstrate that the proposal is legitimate.

_**The deposit period lasts a total of 14 days or until the proposal deposits reach 10,000 UMEE, whichever comes first.**_

Anyone can contribute to the deposit, and deposits of both passed and failed proposals are returned to the contributors. There are three instances in which deposits will be burned instead of returned to the contributors:

#### Expiration

If the deposit period ends before the minimum deposit of 10,000 UMEE is reached, the deposits will be burned. This helps prevent people from spamming governance proposals.

#### Failure to Reach Quorum

If less than 40% of eligible votes are cast, deposits will be burned. This helps encourage mass participation and prevent certain proposals from being quietly passed.

#### Vetoed

If more than 33% of the voting power votes “NoWithVeto,” deposits will be burned. This is an extra precaution in case poor or destructive proposals are able to meet the minimum deposit before the deadline.

By requiring a minimum deposit amount, proposers are incentivized to take the governance process seriously or they risk losing funds.

### The Voting Period

After the minimum deposit has been met for a proposal, the proposal enters the voting period. The voting period is a fixed 5 day period where eligible community members can vote on the proposal. Votes can be cast in the following four ways:

#### Yes

The voter approves the proposal in its existing form.

#### No

The voter does not approve the proposal in its existing form.

#### Abstain

The voter has no preference on the outcome of the vote, but has still participated in the voting process and therefore potentially helped the proposal reach the quorum needed to recover deposits.

#### NoWithVeto

The voter strongly disagrees with the proposal and feels the deposits made should be burned. If the total number of “NoWithVeto” votes are over one third (33.4%) of the total votes (excluding “Abstain” votes) the deposits will be burned instead of being returned to the contributors. Community members should use “NoWithVeto” when they determine a proposal is spam, or harmful to the Umee Hub
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**In order for a governance proposal to pass, the following conditions must be met:**

* A minimum of 10,000 UMEE needs to be deposited within 14 days;
* The 40% voting participation quorum must be reached during the voting period;
* A majority (>50%) of voting power needs to vote “Yes”;
* The total number of “NoWithVeto” votes needs to represent less than a third (33.4%) of the total votes.

## Types of Proposals

### Types of governance proposals include:**

#### Foundation Spend Proposals

> _**Anyone can submit a foundation spend proposal through**_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_

A total of 46% of the genesis supply of UMEE tokens are allocated to the community, and an additional 9% is allocated to the ecosystem. There is a 2% community tax on all staking rewards that will be used to further fund the community pool; this rate can be altered by community governance through a parameter change. Umee community governance participants will use foundation spend proposals to determine how these tokens are used. You can read more about the community and ecosystem pools and their vesting details in the “[<mark style="color:blue;">Tokenomics</mark>]()” section.

How community pool and ecosystem pool funds are spent is entirely up to community governance decisions. A few ways in which the funds might be spent include:

* Creating and funding various Umee DAOs;&#x20;
* Liquidity mining incentives;&#x20;
* Funding large scale community events;&#x20;
* Grants to top contributors;&#x20;
* Strategically acquiring crypto assets to gain voting power in key protocols;&#x20;
* Burning mechanisms.

#### Text Proposals


> _**Anyone can submit a text proposal through**_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_

Text proposals are an on chain representation, or signaling mechanism, for events that may happen off-chain. Unlike parameter change proposals and community spend proposals the results of text proposals are not actually enforceable, though they should always be respected. Text proposals can be used for things like the formation of DAOs or other events that cannot be directly programmed.

#### Parameter Change Proposals


> _**Parameter change proposals require significant technical knowledge.**_&#x20;

Whenever a change is being made to the protocol, a parameter change proposal needs to pass through the governance process. Parameter change proposals can be made for altering things like:

* Inflation parameters;
* Staking parameters;
* Governance parameters;
* Distribution parameters;
* Slashing parameters.

Parameter change proposals need to be carefully reviewed and discussed since they will be automatically executed once passed. <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> [_<mark style="color:blue;">Umee's active parameters can be viewed here</mark>_](https://ping.pub/umee).

## Creating a Proposal

### Before Drafting a Proposal

It’s very important that community members discuss their ideas and receive thorough feedback before starting the proposal process. Some things to take into consideration include:

* How will this proposal benefit the Umee community?&#x20;
* Are there any significant risks associated with the proposal?&#x20;
* Which stakeholders will be impacted the most?&#x20;
* Acknowledging the opposition is always important.

Community members can start by discussing their ideas within any of Umee’s community channels; the channels within <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee’s Governance Forum</mark>](https://commonwealth.im/umee/), and/or the [<mark style="color:blue;">#discussion channel</mark>](https://discord.com/invite/YukEZy8nkc) in the Governance section of the Umee Discord are both good places to start.


> _**When creating a thread to discuss an idea within Umee's Commonwealth, please use the "Discussion" topic tag to help stay organized.**_

It's always a good idea to take a temperature check before submitting an on-chain proposal since on-chain proposals require a deposit which can be lost if [<mark style="color:blue;">certain conditions outlined here</mark>]() are not met. Criticism needs to be taken seriously in order for a proposal to be successful. By actively answering questions and engaging with the community about your idea, it will be more clear if your idea is ready to be crafted into a proposal or not.

### Drafting a Proposal

When drafting a proposal, community members should identify the [<mark style="color:blue;">type of proposal</mark>]() they will be submitting and use the correct formatting. Attention to detail is important, because once a proposal has been submitted on-chain it can no longer be changed.

After drafting the proposal, it’s time to share it with the community. Share completed proposal drafts in the “Proposal Discussion” channel on [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee’s Governance Forum</mark>](https://commonwealth.im/umee/), alongside an off chain poll to gauge sentiment.&#x20;

>_**When sharing a drafted proposal on the governance forum, please be sure to use the “Drafted: Pre-Voting” topic tag to help make the draft easily visible.**_&#x20;

Once a proposal has been shared on the “Proposal Discussion” channel, it’s time to start engaging with the community and collecting feedback. Challengers should be welcomed, and all legitimate questions should be addressed.

## Code of Conduct

1. **Community members should always be respectful of others and make an effort to understand opposing views. No one should ever feel afraid to voice their opinion in Umee’s governance channels.**&#x20;
2. **Community members should work together to provide constructive criticism and collaborate to filter out low effort proposals while improving valid proposals for the betterment of the network.**&#x20;
3. **Governance participants who breach this code of conduct are subject to temporary or permanent removal from Umee's governance channels.**
