# What is Cosmos?

Cosmos is an ecosystem of interoperable and sovereign [blockchains](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain), often referred to as "The Internet of Blockchains." Cosmos users enjoy fast and inexpensive transactions combined with smooth instant transfers between blockchains. Cosmos builders are provided with the tools they need to deploy a blockchain optimized for their specific needs. The future is multi-chain, and Cosmos is building out the infrastructure needed for web3 to achieve mass adoption.

## What Makes Cosmos Unique?

Cosmos doesn't compete with other blockchain ecosystems, but rather complements them.

#### In other blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum:

* Apps are built and deployed on top of a common blockchain or layer 2 sidechains that rely on a main blockchain, making all applications limited by the main chains capabilities;
* As more is built on a single blockchain the user experience typically deteriorates due to the need for higher transaction fees to compete for limited block space;
* Everything built on top of a single blockchain is affected by the success/failure and governance decisions and changes made to the main blockchain;
* Moving funds across different blockchains can be challenging and often relies on centralized bridge providers.

With so many builders creating different products with different goals in mind, it's not efficient for builders all to rely on a single blockchain.

#### In the Cosmos Ecosystem:

* Most applications are built as their own blockchains which allows for better latency, enhanced scalability, less concentration of risk, and more customizability so builders can make adjustments to optimize chains for various use cases;
* Blockchains are interoperable by default;
* The success or failure of one protocol or blockchain is less likely to have a major effect on others, making web3 safer for users and builders alike;
* The Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) allows users to [easily and instantly move funds across blockchains](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens.html#ibc-transfers) without being exposed to a centralized bridge provider;
* In the near future, shared security technology will allow Cosmos blockchains to rent security and consensus through the Cosmos Hub or other chains with large market caps for stronger network security.

## Common Misconceptions

### "Cosmos is the ATOM blockchain"

Many crypto users associate the Cosmos Ecosystem with the ATOM token. ATOM is the [native cryptocurrency](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-crypto.html#native-cryptocurrencies) of the [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-overview/overview.html), the first [blockchain](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) built within the Cosmos Ecosystem. While ATOM is needed to secure, govern, and transact on the Cosmos Hub blockchain, other Cosmos chains like [Umee](/overview/#what-is-umee) typically use their own native cryptocurrency for transaction fees, security, and governance.

ATOM is so prevalent within the Cosmos Ecosystem because it has gathered widespread support as a form of money within Cosmos. Many of the most well known builders within the Cosmos Ecosystem originally helped build the Cosmos Hub. Using ATOM is also one of the [easiest ways for new users to bring money into the Cosmos Ecosystem](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#withdrawing-native-atom-tokens) since it has deep liquidity and is widely available across centralized exchanges.

### "Cosmos is an Ethereum competitor"

Cosmos was built to help complement preexisting [blockchains](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) like Ethereum. Many Cosmos blockchains are actually built to help service current Ethereum users, e.g. Umee with its cross chain ability with Ethereum. While the Cosmos Ecosystem itself is not an Ethereum competitor, certain blockchains built within the Cosmos ecosystem may challenge Ethereum in the future.

### "Staking rewards are a form of income in the Cosmos Ecosystem"

Since Cosmos blockchains use a [Proof of Stake consensus mechanism](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain.html#types-of-blockchains), users can [stake native tokens on their native blockchains](/users/staking-umee/staking-umee) in order to earn "staking rewards." Staking rewards are paid in the form of the native tokens that are being staked. While many see this as a form of passive income, it's important to know that most PoS tokens like the [native UMEE token](/overview/umee-token) are inflationary, and staking rewards represent the block rewards earned by those who [stake tokens](/users/staking-umee/staking-umee) to help secure the network.

Many PoS chains like Umee typically have a "target staking participation rate," or a goal for the percentage of total tokens that should be staked.

* When the actual staking participation rate is lower than the target, stakers are increasing their market share since the same amount of inflation is being distributed to fewer participants;
* When the actual staking participation rate is equal to the target, block rewards are equal to the token inflation. This means stakers are maintaining the same market share by keeping their tokens staked.
* Users who do not stake their tokens are penalized by having their market share diluted over time.

It is worth noting that new projects within the Cosmos Ecosystem often airdrop significant portions of their genesis supply to users who stake tokens on other networks. This allows projects to distribute their tokens widely to active ecosystem participants.
