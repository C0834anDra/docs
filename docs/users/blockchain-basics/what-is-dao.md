# What is a DAO?

![](/bg/what-is-a-dao.png)

Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs for short, can be thought of as community owned and operated organizations that are native to the internet. Traditional organizations typically have a hierarchical structure with a few key people making decisions for the entire organization, while DAOs can allow all of their participants to submit and vote on proposals to be implemented.

In order to allow community contributors and investors to govern the organization, DAOs usually issue a [governance token](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-crypto.html#governance-tokens) to represent voting power. The more governance tokens an individual holds, the greater his/her influence over the DAO is. Governance tokens should be widely distributed to users, team members, dedicated community contributors, and investors in order to better align interests to help make a DAO successful.

Umee is a DAO itself, governed by UMEE token stakers. SubDAOs are being built within Umee to focus on and manage individual segments.&#x20;
