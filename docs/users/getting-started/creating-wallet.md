**Select if you’d prefer a 12 or 24 word secret recovery phrase, and write it down.**

> _**It's very important that you safely store and never share your secret recovery phrase! This is the only backup to your wallet in the event your device is lost or destroyed.** Failure to properly store and conceal your secret recovery phrase will most likely result in the loss of assets stored in your wallet._
