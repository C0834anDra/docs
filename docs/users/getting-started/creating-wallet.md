In order to enjoy Umee's cross chain DeFi capabilities, an Umee blockchain compatible wallet is needed. [Users can learn more general information about crypto wallets here](/users/blockchain-basics/what-is-wallet).

> Before setting up an Umee blockchain compatible wallet, every new user needs to know the following:
>
> * Never share your seed phrase or mnemonic with anyone for any reason;
> * Never enter your seed phrase or mnemonic anywhere;
> * Never engage with unknown links that are shared with you;
> * Never screen share with a stranger;
> * Never sign unknown transactions;
> * Use a hardware wallet for extra security.

#### Select if you’d prefer a 12 or 24 word secret recovery phrase, and write it down.

> It's very important that you safely store and never share your secret recovery phrase! This is the only backup to your wallet in the event your device is lost or destroyed.** Failure to properly store and conceal your secret recovery phrase will most likely result in the loss of assets stored in your wallet.
