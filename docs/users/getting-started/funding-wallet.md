# Funding a Wallet

**A [native UMEE token](/overview/umee-token.html#token-format) balance is required in order to transact on the Umee blockchain. The UMEE token is supported on several centralized exchanges including OKX, MEXC, Gate.io, and FTX. Depending on the exchange being used, the tokens may be in their _**native Cosmos**_ format or in their _**ERC-20**_ (Ethereum) format.**

> _**If you are in possession of native UMEE tokens on a centralized exchange, you can withdraw them directly to your Umee wallet.**_

> _**If you are in possession of ERC-20 UMEE tokens you will need to**_ [convert them to their native format](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens) _**in order to fund an Umee wallet.**_

## Withdrawing Native Cosmos Tokens

> _**If your exchange of choice does not support the native UMEE token it's recommended to purchase and withdraw ATOM, the native Cosmos Hub token, to the Cosmos network in your Umee blockchain compatible wallet. These tokens can easily be [exchanged for native UMEE tokens](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#purchasing-umee-on-a-dex).**_
