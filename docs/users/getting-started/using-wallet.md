# Using a Wallet

![](/bg/using-a-wallet.png)

#### Users should familiarize themselves with how an [Umee blockchain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet) works before [funding the wallet](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet) or sending any tokens.

> The Cosmos ecosystem is commonly referred to as "The Internet of Blockchains" because it is an ecosystem of sovereign yet interoperable blockchains, unlike other blockchain ecosystems where most apps are built directly on top of a single chain. Cosmos allows for the seamless transfer of data between blockchains in order to foster a better and safer user experience.

> [Umee blockchain compatible wallets](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet) like Keplr are interchain wallets, meaning they can also be used as wallets for other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.

_**Changing networks within a wallet extension allows users to view their wallet addresses, token balances, and send or receive tokens. Users do not need to manually change the network when interacting with the Umee web app.**_

****

## To Change Networks

#### Open up the Keplr wallet browser extension and select the network list drop down at the top of the extension.

Users will need to copy and paste their wallet address in order to receive tokens to their [Umee blockchain compatible wallets](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet).

****

## To Copy a Wallet Address

#### Open the wallet extension and select _**the network which tokens are being sent from**_ in the network dropdown list.

![For this example we will be selecting the Umee network to demonstrate that the tokens are being sent from another Umee wallet.](/bg/receiving-tokens-1.png)

#### Identify the string of numbers and letters found near the top of the extension, just below the wallet name. Click on it to copy it to your clipboard.

> Umee wallet addresses will always begin with "umee."

#### You have now copied your wallet address! Native UMEE tokens can be sent to the address instantly.

Crypto users can use their wallets to instantly send assets to another user without the need for a centralized third party.

****

## To Send Tokens

#### Open the wallet extension and select the network you'd like to send tokens on.

![For this example we will be sending native UMEE tokens on the Umee network.](/bg/send-tokens-1.png)

#### Select "Send."

#### Paste the wallet address you are sending tokens to.

> This wallet address must be associated with an account on the same network. If you're sending tokens on the Umee network, the wallet address will start with "umee."

> It's very important to confirm the receiving address before sending tokens. Transactions are irreversible.

#### Select the dropdown and choose which token you'd like to send.

> Tokens will be received on the same network they are sent from, regardless of the type of token being sent.

![For this example we will be sending native UMEE tokens, so "UMEE" is selected.](/bg/send-tokens-4.png)

#### Input the amount of tokens you'd like to send.

> If you're sending native tokens used for gas, don't forget to keep some to cover the transaction fee.

![](/bg/send-tokens-5.png)

#### Input a transaction memo if desired.

> A memo is a brief message that accompanies the transaction, and is optional for most transactions. Memos can be useful to help users stay organized.

> All memos are public and can be viewed by anyone on the blockchain.

> Centralized exchanges will often require a memo so they know which account to credit when tokens are deposited. Familiarize yourself with the practices of your centralized exchange of choice before depositing tokens.

#### Select the desired transaction fee, and click "Send," and approve the transaction.

![](/bg/send-tokens-7.png)

#### You have now sent tokens from your crypto wallet!

> Transactions on the Umee blockchain usually process within a few seconds.

> Centralized exchanges may take a while to process incoming transactions. Please be patient and do not panic if your tokens do not arrive immediately. Contact the support team at your centralized exchange of choice if you have any questions.
