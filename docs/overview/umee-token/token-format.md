# Token Format

![Native UMEE tokens are used across the Cosmos ecosystem, while ERC-20 UMEE tokens are used across the Ethereum ecosystem.](/bg/token-format.png)

Different blockchains typically use different versions of tokens. Most tokens can be used across blockchains if converted to the correct format. It’s important to know which type of tokens you are in possession of before interacting with any web3 applications.


> The UMEE token exists in two forms: a Cosmos native version (the native UMEE token) and an ERC-20 token version native to Ethereum. The two forms of UMEE tokens can be freely [converted to one another](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens).

### Native UMEE Tokens

****

> Most Cosmos tokens like the native UMEE token are interoperable with other Cosmos blockchains by design. Cosmos ecosystem users can easily transfer tokens between chains in a fast and trustless manner.

_**The main purpose of the native UMEE token** is to participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to help secure the Umee blockchain and earn PoS staking yield, pay gas fees on the Umee blockchain to execute Umee’s cross chain DeFi transactions, and to be able to vote and participate in protocol governance decisions._

**You are in possession of the **_**native UMEE token**_** native to the Umee blockchain if any of the following are true:**

- Your tokens are stored in an Umee blockchain compatible wallet like Keplr.
- You purchased UMEE on a Cosmos-based decentralized exchange.
- You bridged UMEE from Ethereum to the Umee blockchain.

### ERC-20 UMEE Tokens

****

> ERC-20 tokens are not compatible with Cosmos blockchains unless converted to a Cosmos native format. Similarly, native Cosmos tokens are not compatible with Ethereum blockchains unless converted to an ERC-20 format.

_**The main purpose of the ERC-20 UMEE token** is to create a user-friendly experience for Umee to tap into the DeFi legos on Ethereum and allow  people to seamlessly access the UMEE token as an ERC-20 token and hold or trade it on centralized exchanges._

**You are in possession of the **_**ERC-20 UMEE token**_** native to the Ethereum blockchain if any of the following are true:**

- Your tokens are stored in an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.
- You purchased UMEE on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.
- You bridged UMEE from the Umee blockchain to Ethereum.
