# New Asset Listing Guide

Umee allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. Umee follows a formal listing process that allows the protocol to [assess risk using a targeted framework](/governance/asset-listing/risk-assessment-methodology) that scrutinizes key risk areas including market risk (volume, volatility, market cap), centralization of asset, protocol risk, etc. 

Anyone can submit a proposal for a new asset to be listed on Umee by creating a "New Asset Listing Proposal" thread on [Umee's governance forum](https://gov.umee.cc/). An off-chain poll is used to gauge community sentiment around a New Asset Listing Proposal, and the Umee Core team will submit an on-chain "Token Registry Proposal" for assets that gain clear support.

While all assets that are accepted by Umee's governance will be listed on Umee, different assets have different levels of risk that will be assessed by a risk team. Proposers should provide as much of the relevant information as possible to help Umee make an informed decision.

### Submitting the Proposal

****

> It's recommended that proposal authors wait at least four days, or until significant discussion has taken place, before submitting their New Asset Listing Proposals on-chain for a vote. Authors who submit poor proposals on-chain may risk losing their [UMEE deposits](/governance/governance-overview/how-it-works.html#the-deposit-period).

#### 1) Select the "+" in the upper righthand corner of [Umee's governance forum](https://gov.umee.cc/) and then select the "New On-Chain Proposal" button.

![](/bg/select-new-proposal.png)

#### 2) Choose "Text Proposal" from the Proposal Type dropdown.

#### 3) Title the proposal "Signaling Proposal: Add Support for [Asset Name]"

#### 4) Provide a brief description and be sure to include the link to the New Asset Listing Proposal thread and discussion.

#### 5) Double check that all details are correct. Once a proposal has been submitted on-chain it cannot be altered.

#### 6) Enter the amount of UMEE tokens you'd like to contribute towards the deposit. To make the full deposit, 100,000 UMEE tokens are required. 

> Make note that deposits are denominated in uumee (100,000 UMEE = 100,000,000,000 uumee).

> Proposals must reach the 100,000 UMEE deposit threshold within 14 days in order to enter the voting period. Deposits for proposals which fail to reach the deposit threshold within 14 days will NOT be returned to the depositors.

#### 7) Select "Send transaction" and approve the transaction in your wallet.

> Once the New Asset Listing Proposal has been submitted on-chain, nothing more is needed from the proposer. The Umee core team will review the results of signaling proposals and submit "Token Registry Proposals" with carefully crafted risk parameters on-chain as soon as the asset in question can safely be supported on Umee.
